These files are for manually eye-balling if the syntax is working.

They contain things that can't be easily tested with SYNTAX TEST or that I have no idea how to test with SYNTAX TEST such as:

 - Blank first line
 - Testing the behaviour of the second line when it is *actually* the second line
 - A Combination of everything to see how it all looks together without a bunch of test lines in the way.
